SFISH Shell
Write a C program named sfish (an acronym for System Fundamentals Interactive SHell) that functions similar
to other shells that you are familiar with, like GNU’s Bash. You’re welcome to study the code for bash and other
shells, but the code you submit MUST be your own!
Your shell, if completed correctly, will have the:
Ability to execute builtins such as set , exit , etc.
Ability to execute programs such as ls , grep , etc.
Ability to redirect input/output for processes started by the shell.
Ability to chain processes together
Ability to control and interact with processes running in the foreground or the background
